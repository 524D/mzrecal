* Handle non-peak picked input?
* Output log file with e.g. which identifications where not matched to
  a peak in MS1, how many identifications did not match score filter,
  performance timing for each step.
* Remove peptides which don't match score filter
* Compute the recalibration
*   Implement the recalibration functions for different instruments

* From recalibration parameters, create re-calibrated mzml file
