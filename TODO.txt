* Check why recalibrated regression line in recal is not horizontal
* Check why Thermo FTICR doesn't use correct recal function
* Test on more instruments
* Test on more search engines
* Recalibration minimizes the absolute error of calibrants,
  but it should probably minimize relative error (ppm)
* Find out why number of identifications sometimes gets less
* Avoid command line options e.g. by using mass error range from search engine
* Add documentation about debug facilities
* Smooth calibration coefficients
* Interpolate coefficients for non-calibrated spectra
* Create web interface
* Handle non-peak picked input?
* Generate indexed mzML file automatically
* Output log file with e.g. which identifications where not matched to
  a peak in MS1, how many identifications did not match score filter,
  performance timing for each step.
* (optionally) discard identifications that result in nearly the same
  MS1 mass (but not the ones that are equal to within numeric accuracy,
  because they have the same elemental composition and should be merged)
