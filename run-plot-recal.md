# Plotting recalibration results

This describes how to install the software needed to create plots with the plot-recal.R script, and how to run this script.
This script can only be used with search results of Comet.

Note: plot-recal.R is purely ised for visualisation and thus not an "official" part of mzRecal. We can offer no support in using
this script.

## Installation

Note: installation must be executed with root (Linux)/ Administrator (Windows) privileges.

* Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/ 
* Install rtools https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
* Start R:
    ```
    cd "\Program Files\R\R-4.1.0"
    R
    ```
* Install standard R packages. From the R command prompt:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("stringr", "futile.logger", "optparse", "ggplot2", "gridExtra"))
    ```
* Install BioConductor. From the R command prompt:
    ```R
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install(version = "3.14")
    ```
* Install MSnbase.  From the R command prompt:
    ```R
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install("MSnbase")
    ```

## Execution

After the above software is installed, plots can be generated by running from the command prompt:

```
Rscript plot-recal.R -e 0.01 -m 10 --outfile=recalplot --name="Plot of mRecal results" orig.mzid recalibrated.mzid
```

Where option -e is the cutoff value for the Comet expect score and option -m is the maximum ppm error included in the plot, and the final arguments are the mzID file of the original and recalibrated data.
